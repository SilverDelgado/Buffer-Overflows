 abstract = {The career and family outcomes of college graduate women suggest that the twentieth century contained five distinct cohorts. The first cohort, graduating college from 1900 to 1920, had either "family or career." The second, graduating from 1920 to 1945, had "job then family." The third cohort, the college graduate mothers of the baby boom, graduated from 1946 to the mid-1960s and had "family then job." Among the fourth cohort, graduating college from the late 1960s to 1980 and whose stated goal was "career then family," 13 to 18 percent achieved both by age forty. The objective of the fifth cohort, graduating from around 1980 to 1990, has been "career and family," and 21 to 28 percent have realized that goal by age forty. The author traces the demographic and labor force experiences of these five cohorts of college graduates and discusses why "career and family" outcomes changed over time.},

    abstract = { Evidence suggests that possessing more qualifications than is necessary for a job (i.e., overqualification) negatively impacts job candidates’ outcomes. However, unfair discounting of women’s qualifications and negative assumptions about women’s career commitment imply that female candidates must be overqualified to achieve the same outcomes as male candidates. Across two studies, experimental and qualitative data provide converging evidence in support of this assertion, showing that gender differences in how overqualification impacts hiring outcomes are due to the type of commitment—firm or career—that is most salient during evaluations. Overqualified men are perceived to be less committed to the prospective firm, and less likely to be hired as a result, than sufficiently qualified men. But overqualified women are perceived to be more committed to their careers than qualified women because overqualification helps overcome negative assumptions that are made about women’s career commitment. Overqualification also does not decrease perceptions of women’s firm commitment like it does for men: supplemental qualitative and experimental evidence reveals that hiring managers rationalize women’s overqualification in a way they cannot for men by relying on gender stereotypes about communality and assumptions about candidates’ experiences with gender discrimination at prior firms. These findings suggest that female candidates must demonstrate their commitment along two dimensions (firm and career), but male candidates need only demonstrate their commitment along one dimension (firm). Taken together, differences in how overqualification impacts male versus female candidates’ outcomes are evidence of gender inequality in hiring processes, operating through gendered assumptions about commitment.Funding: This research was funded by internal faculty research funds provided by Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.1550. }

 abstract = {This study uses human capital and gender stratification theory to answer three research questions concerning the gendered patterns of precarious employment, the effects of human capital investments and family obligations on precarious employment, and the extent that these investments and obligations affect precarious employment differently for men and women. Lucrative jobs that offer benefits, union protection, with full-time work status were considered indicators of high quality and therefore non-precarious employment. Using data from U.S. respondents, findings suggest: a) a "gender" to precarious employment in that women are more likely to work in low quality job settings; b) gender discrepancies in benefits and union protection are explained by differences in men's and women's human capital, family investments, and other work-related situations; and, c) gender differences in wages and part-time work status result from workplace discrimination towards women. The implications of these findings are discussed along with recommendations for future research.},

However, women have been facing underemployment for some time. Familiar terms abound to describe the experiences unique to women in the paid labor market (e.g., glass ceiling, sticky floor, old boys club, pay equity, occupational ghetto, pink collar, double day, and second shift). These denote the reasons for women being more at risk of underemployment. Systemic discrimination, occupational and job segregation, wage inequality, the sexual division of unpaid labor, and more limited returns to education and experience all challenge a woman's ability to achieve labor market equity with her male counterparts because they prevent the full usage and recognition of her knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs).",

Therefore, those characteristics shared by workers whose level of education exceeds what is required for their occupation (over-educated workers), and the extent to which this is associated with receiving lower income on the job market, are explored. A data pool from the National Household Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares) for the years 2001 to 2011, and a panel from the same survey for 2007 to 2011, are analyzed. The estimation of logit models shows evidence that living in rural areas, working at companies with less than ten  employees,  being  salaried,  among  other  characteristics,  are  positively  associated  with  the  probability of being over-educated. The results on income are estimated by way of the models of Verdugo and Verdugo and of Duncan and Hoffman, using both cross-sectional and panel data (by way of fixed effects and instrumental variables). In the case of workers with higher education, it  is  found  that  over-education  can  be  associated  with  salaries  that  are  lower  by  more  than  13  percentage  points.  This  analysis  is  performed  for  four  different  over-education  identification  methodologies.}

It is found that of the four different definitions of overeducation distinguished in the literature, only the one based on variation in years of education within occupational groups appears to yield significantly lower-than-average rates of overeducation. The average rate of undereducation in the labor market depends on the definition of the undereducation variable. There is no indication that mismatches between education supplied and education required for the job have increased significantly in the past 20 years. The labor force growth rate has a positive effect on the incidence of overeducation, while the unemployment rate has a negative effect on the rate of return to education.}

For a database of Flemish school leavers, four alternative measures of overeducation are related to job satisfaction, mobility, training participation and wages. The magnitude and significance of the effects diverge between these measures. When attained education is controlled for, overeducated workers are less satisfied, more mobile, participate less in training and earn less than adequately educated workers. When required education is controlled for, no robust results are found for job satisfaction and training participation. Overeducated workers earn more than adequately educated colleagues, but have a higher turnover rate. We have little clear results with respect to undereducation. Caution is thus recommended for the interpretation of empirical results with respect to the impact of over- and undereducation.},

Contrary to the assumptions of assignment theory, this effect is not explained by skill mismatches.

Since workers’ levels of schooling and their occupations’ required level of education both affect wages, policymakers may find it useful to note if such mismatches exist, if they impact wages, and if they can be avoided. Empirical results from Mexico suggest that in order to obtain the maximum economic benefits from increases in educational attainment levels, a developing country needs to take steps to assure increases in occupational levels also occur. Additional evidence of the positive link between educational attainment and wages is also provided. Due to the multi-period nature of the data; a new method of measuring required education is developed which opens up the education-occupation matching literature to data sets which are not cross sectional in nature.}

First, undereducation is the outcome of a process in which market-acquired capital substitutes for insufficient school-supplied qualifications, whereas overeducation is associated with excess schooling but short tenure and job experience. The second hypothesis calls upon changes in the technology of production and marketing to explain why some workers end up as inadequately educated for the tasks that they perform, while at the same time, others (holding identical jobs but more schooling) are perceived to be overeducated. Our findings appear to leave little room for explanations of the overeducation/undereducation phenomenon rooted in the trade-off between different forms of human capital. The hypothesis of technology-induced pockets of overeducation and undereducation is consistent with Portuguese reality, characterized in the last decade by intensive efforts to promote economic growth, to modernize the industrial structure and to upgrade educational qualifications.

abstract = {Research is reported that examines changes between 1960 and 1976 in the incidence of overeducation, defined as the discrepancy between the educational attainments of workers and the educational requirements of their jobs. Estimates are derived at the aggregate level and separately for race and sex groups. Results suggest that the overall incidence of overeducation has increased in recent times because the skill requirements of jobs have changed only slightly, while the educational attainments of workers have increased substantially. Whites continue to be less overeducated than blacks, but the gap has narrowed.}

Using the 1985 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, our results confirm earlier work showing that the rate of return to required schooling exceeds the rate of return to overschooling, and that the rate of return to underschooling is negative. At the same time, our results also confirm that, on the average, persons whose schooling exceeds (is less than) the required schooling for their occupation or job, respectively, receive lower (higher) wages than workers with similar levels of schooling in occupations or jobs having the required schooling. These results remain robust for alternative definitions of required, over- and underschooling, as well as for alternative specifications of the wage equations.}

Undereducation has been reduced, overeducation has been increased. This does not imply private or social inefficiency, as even years of “overeducation” earn a positive rate of return. A general specification of the earnings function is derived from allocation models of the labor market. It contains the human capital specification and the job competition specification as special cases, and proves superior to both.}

abstract = {This paper examines the relation between overeducation and enterprise-related schooling. If overeducation and enterprise-related schooling are substitutes the social costs of Overeducation are less. We find that correctly allocated workers have the highest probability of participation in enterprise-related schooling, while undereducated workers have the lowest probability of participation. There is no evidence of overeducation and enterprise-related schooling being either substitutes or complements. If we do not correct for self-selection, the average return on a year of education for correctly allocated workers is higher than the average rate of return to education for under- and overeducated workers. If we correct for self-selection in the participation in enterprise-related schooling the rate of return to education increases. The rates of return to under- and overeducation increase as well. If we correct for self-selection the rate of return to a year of undereducation becomes higher than the rate of return to a year of actual education. For undereducated workers the wage gain of participation in enterprise-related schooling is higher than for a correctly allocated worker. A year of Overeducation decreases the wage gain of participation in enterprise-related schooling for participants.}

We frame our empirical work according to the occupational mobility theory. Using a cross-section of workers from a representative survey of the Spanish labor force, we consider overeducated workers to be those who report that the level of education their jobs require is below the level of education they have attained. Our results indicate that overeducated workers have less experience, decreased on-the-job training and higher turnover than other comparable workers. We also observe an improvement in the job match over age and mobility.},

abstract = {This study analyses the gender overeducation gap, meaning differences between partnered men and women in the degree of holding a job with lower requirements compared to one's own education, and how working from home (WfH) affects overeducation. Contextualising education–job mismatches in the digital age, we update an old topic of labour market research considering new options of spatial flexibility via WfH. Using a unique German dataset of the core employed population in 2018 (i.e., individuals that are at least 15 years old and report paid work for at least 10h per week), our results show a gender overeducation gap, with women at a higher risk of overeducation than men. By applying a latent variable approach with simultaneous regressions to account for potential selection into jobs allowing WfH, we find that the WfH option carries a lower overeducation risk. Moreover, the findings suggest a gender-specific benefit of WfH: women show higher overeducation risks among employees without the WfH option, but the gender overeducation gap is closed among those with the WfH option.}

abstract = {Abstract While most previous research has studied underemployment among laid-off workers or new college graduates in domestic settings, this study investigates underemployment among managers in overseas assignments. Using data from 268 expatriates from six Fortune 500 multinational firms, the results here suggest that several important job- and organizational-level factors may contribute to underemployment among expatriates: hierarchical job level, assignment tenure, the extent to which expatriates have specific projects to complete, the degree of free choice in the decision to go overseas, the amount of on-site mentoring, and the strategic importance of the overseas site. In contrast to previous research, then, the present study suggests that many expatriates are overqualified, as well as underqualified, for their overseas assignments. Moreover, this underemployment is negatively related to expatriates' job attitudes, general mental health, and self-reported job performance. In addition, mediated regression analyses revealed that underemployment is an important intervening link between antecedent and outcome variables. The implications of the results for future theory development, empirical research, and management practice on underemployment are discussed as well. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
